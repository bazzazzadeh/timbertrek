    It is essential to understand how machine learning (ML) models make
    predictions in high-stakes settings such as healthcare, finance, and
    criminal justice. ML researchers have made great strides in developing
    interpretable models, and recent research focuses on
    <strong>operationalizing interpretability</strong> â€” leveraging an understanding of
    the domain to create more responsible and trustworthy ML systems.

  - >
    To help ML practitioners build trustworthy models, researchers have very
    recently developed a technique to generate the set of almost-optimal sparse
    interpretable decision trees. This set of high-performing models is called
    the <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01755">Rashomon
    set</a>, named after the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-3/Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a/10.1214/ss/1009213726.full">Rashomon
    effect</a> in statistics. A Rashomon set of sparse decision trees can have
    <em>thousands of inherently interpretable and almost-equally accurate
    models</em>, providing opportunities for users to choose ones that best
    align with their knowledge and needs (e.g., fairness, monotonicity,
    simplicity). However, the large size and diversity of Rashomon sets pose
    challenges for users to effectively explore and compare all these good
    models. TimberTrek is the first interactive visualization tool designed to
    tackle this critical challenge through <strong>summarizing the whole Rashomon
    set</strong> of sparse decision trees and empowering users to <strong>curate
    accurate and trustworthy models</strong>.

usage:
  p1: >
    With a flexible interface design, there are two options to use TimberTrek to
    explore your Rashomon sets. The first option is to select <a href='#top'
    style="font-variant: small-caps;">my set</a> on the top of this page, and
    then upload your Rashomon trie data by dragging it to the interface (Video
    2-1). You can follow the instruction in the tool to learn how to generate
    the Rashomon JSON file.

  p2: >
    You can directly use TimberTrek in any computational notebooks (e.g.,
    Jupyter Notebook/Lab, Google Colab, and VS Code). To do that, you only need
    to install TimberTrek's Python package via <code>pip install
    timbertrek</code>. Then you can create a TimberTrek instance by passing your
    Rashomon trie data. With <a href="https://github.com/xiaohk/stickyland"
    target="_blank">Sticky Cells</a>, you can even create multiple
    repositionable TimberTrek windows and compare different subsets of a
    Rashomon set side by side! Try TimberTrek in the Jupyter Notebook below.

    With multiple tightly integrated views, you can use TimberTrek to
    <em>explore</em>, <em>compare</em>, and <em>curate</em> sparse decision
    trees that align with your knowledge and values.

          TimberTrek's primary view is a <a
          href='https://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/ii/sunburst/'
          target='_blank'>Sunburst</a> that summarizes all decision trees in the
          Rashomon set. We generate this Sunburst by extracting all decision
          paths (path from the tree root to a leaf) from all decision trees in
          the Rashomon set. The Sunburst has \(k\) rings, where \(k\) is the
          height of the tallest tree in the Rashomon set. Each ring correspond
          to a level of the decision path.
        - >
          Each ring is split into multiple sectors where each sector correspond
          to a testing condition of the decision tree. We color code the sectors
          based on the feature attributes. For example, <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #4E79A7">number of prior crime</span>,  <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #F28E2C">age</span>, and <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #76B7B2">sex</span>. For features that have multiple values, we use color lightness
          to encode different values. For example, <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #4E79A7">prior > 3</span>,  <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #6B95C4">prior = 0</span>, and <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #88B1E2">prior = 1</span>. Finally, we use <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          hsl(0,0%, 60%)">gray</span> to color encode <span class="feature-tag"
          style="color: hsl(0,0%, 60%)">leaf nodes</span> (end of a decision
          path). Each <span class="feature-tag" style="color: hsl(0,0%,
          60%)">leaf node</span> is linked to a decision tree that has the
          corresponding decision path. Sectors are positioned based on their
          hierarchical relationship in the decision rule. For example, if we
          have two sectors aligned as <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #4E79A7">prior > 3</span>,  <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #F28E2C">age < 26</span>, it means all decision rules after these two sectors use <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #4E79A7">prior > 3</span> as the first split and <span class="feature-tag" style="color:
          #F28E2C">age < 26</span> as the second split.
        - >
          You can click a sector to "zoom into" a subset of decision trees with
          the selected decision path patterns. It makes the Sunburst to only
          display decision rules with a feature order up to the clicked sector.
          You can hover over a <span class="feature-tag" style="color: hsl(0,0%,
          60%)">leaf node</span> to see a preview of its linked decision tree.
          Some Rashomon set can have very tall trees. Therefore, you can use the
          depth menu (on the top left) to control how many levels to show in the
          Sunburst; it is helpful to focus on a few levels at a time.
