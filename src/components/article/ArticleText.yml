    It is essential to understand how machine learning (ML) models make
    predictions in high-stakes settings such as healthcare, finance, and
    criminal justice. ML researchers have made great strides in developing
    interpretable models, and recent research focuses on
    <strong>operationalizing interpretability</strong> â€” leveraging an understanding of
    the domain to create more responsible and trustworthy ML systems.

    To help ML practitioners build trustworthy models, researchers have very
    recently developed a technique to generate the set of almost-optimal sparse
    interpretable decision trees. This set of high-performing models is called
    the <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01755">Rashomon
    set</a>, named after the <a target="_blank"
    href="https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-16/issue-3/Statistical-Modeling--The-Two-Cultures-with-comments-and-a/10.1214/ss/1009213726.full">Rashomon
    effect</a> in statistics. A Rashomon set of sparse decision trees can have
    <em>thousands of inherently interpretable and almost-equally accurate
    models</em>, providing opportunities for users to choose ones that best
    align with their knowledge and needs (e.g., fairness, monotonicity,
    simplicity). However, the large size and diversity of Rashomon sets pose
    challenges for users to effectively explore and compare all these good
    models. TimberTrek is the first interactive visualization tool designed to
    tackle this critical challenge through <strong>summarizing the whole Rashomon
    set</strong> of sparse decision trees and empowering users to <strong>curate
    accurate and trustworthy models</strong>.

    With a flexible interface design, there are two options to use TimberTrek to explore
    your Rashomon sets. The first option is to select MY SET on the top of
    this page, and then upload your Rashomon trie data by dragging it to
    the interface (Video 2-1). You can follow the instruction in the tool to learn
    how to generate the Rashomon JSON file.

  p2: >
    You can directly use TimberTrek in any computational notebooks (e.g.,
    Jupyter Notebook/Lab, Google Colab, and VS Code). To do that, you only need
    to install TimberTrek's Python package via <code>pip install
    timbertrek</code>. Then you can create a TimberTrek instance by passing your
    Rashomon trie data. With <a href="https://github.com/xiaohk/stickyland"
    target="_blank">Sticky Cells</a>, you can even create multiple
    repositionable TimberTrek windows and compare different subsets of a
    Rashomon set side by side! Try TimberTrek in the Jupyter Notebook below.

    With multiple tightly integrated views, you can use TimberTrek to
    <em>explore</em>, <em>compare</em>, and <em>curate</em> sparse decision
    trees that align with your knowledge and values.
